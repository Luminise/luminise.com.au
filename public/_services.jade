        ### Quality Management System

        Luminise has partnered with Lucent Labs (an IT company) and is currently developing a comprehensive
        cloud based solution for Quality Management.

        Providing care services carries serious business risks and legal consequences. With a wide range of 
        governing laws and guidelines it is essential for organisations to understand these requirements and 
        remain aware of changes as they occur. Combining the specialised skills that Luminise and Lucent Labs 
        possess has enabled us to develop a high quality solution for organisations to meet their requirements and 
        also drive a business that remains ahead of the pack.

        The Quality Management System provides all the documentation and processes required to deliver care
        services and includes:

        - A full suite of Care policies and procedures that is kept up to date at all times. These can be tailored to different care service options and are specific to organisational  preferences and structure. Current policies and procedures have been written to meet the specific requirements of retirement villages providing care services on-site.
        - Workflows to enhance efficiency and meet legislative requirements including:
          * Staff governance documentation and recording
          * WHS reporting
          * Care assessments and care planning
          * Staff meetings
          * Feedback
          * Continuous improvement
        - Training calendars and e-learning solutions for Mandatory Training
